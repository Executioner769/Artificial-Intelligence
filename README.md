## Maze solving using A* Algorithm
  ### *Description:*
  - [A* Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) is used to find the optimal path from the start cell to end cell in the given maze.
  - [Pyamaze](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-python-module-for-maze-search-algorithms-64e7d1297c96) python library has been used to generate maze.
